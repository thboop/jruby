#
# In concurrent programming, a monitor is an object or module intended to be
# used safely by more than one thread. The defining characteristic of a
# monitor is that its methods are executed with mutual exclusion. That is, at
# each point in time, at most one thread may be executing any of its methods.
# This mutual exclusion greatly simplifies reasoning about the implementation
# of monitors compared to reasoning about parallel code that updates a data
# structure.
#
# You can read more about the general principles on the Wikipedia page for
# Monitors[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_%28synchronization%29].
#
# == Examples
#
# === Simple object.extend
#
#   require 'monitor.rb'
#
#   buf = []
#   buf.extend(MonitorMixin)
#   empty_cond = buf.new_cond
#
#   # consumer
#   Thread.start do
#     loop do
#       buf.synchronize do
#         empty_cond.wait_while { buf.empty? }
#         print buf.shift
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   # producer
#   while line = ARGF.gets
#     buf.synchronize do
#       buf.push(line)
#       empty_cond.signal
#     end
#   end
#
# The consumer thread waits for the producer thread to push a line to buf
# while <tt>buf.empty?</tt>. The producer thread (main thread) reads a
# line from ARGF and pushes it into buf then calls <tt>empty_cond.signal</tt>
# to notify the consumer thread of new data.
#
# === Simple Class include
#
#   require 'monitor'
#
#   class SynchronizedArray < Array
#
#     include MonitorMixin
#
#     def initialize(*args)
#       super(*args)
#     end
#
#     alias :old_shift :shift
#     alias :old_unshift :unshift
#
#     def shift(n=1)
#       self.synchronize do
#         self.old_shift(n)
#       end
#     end
#
#     def unshift(item)
#       self.synchronize do
#         self.old_unshift(item)
#       end
#     end
#
#     # other methods ...
#   end
#
# +SynchronizedArray+ implements an Array with synchronized access to items.
# This Class is implemented as subclass of Array which includes the
# MonitorMixin module.
#

# Documentation comments:
#  - All documentation comes from Nutshell.
#  - MonitorMixin.new_cond appears in the example, but is not documented in
#    Nutshell.
#  - All the internals (internal modules Accessible and Initializable, class
#    ConditionVariable) appear in RDoc.  It might be good to hide them, by
#    making them private, or marking them :nodoc:, etc.
#  - RDoc doesn't recognise aliases, so we have mon_synchronize documented, but
#    not synchronize.
#  - mon_owner is in Nutshell, but appears as an accessor in a separate module
#    here, so is hard/impossible to RDoc.  Some other useful accessors
#    (mon_count and some queue stuff) are also in this module, and don't appear
#    directly in the RDoc output.
#  - in short, it may be worth changing the code layout in this file to make the
#    documentation easier
